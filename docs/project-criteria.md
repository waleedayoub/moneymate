## Project Criteria
- So as a reminder, for this LLM application to be "fully functional" it needs to satisfy the following conditions:
  * Select a dataset that you're interested in
  * Ingest the data into a knowledge base
  * Implement the RAG flow: query the knowledge base, build the prompt, send the promt to an LLM
  * Evaluate the performance of your RAG flow
  * Create an interface for the application
  * Collect user feedback and monitor your application
- And the evaluation details are below:
  * Problem description
      * 0 points: The problem is not described
      * 1 point: The problem is described but briefly or unclearly
      * 2 points: The problem is well-described and it's clear what problem the project solves
  * RAG flow
      * 0 points: No knowledge base or LLM is used
      * 1 point: No knowledge base is used, and the LLM is queried directly
      * 2 points: Both a knowledge base and an LLM are used in the RAG flow 
  * Retrieval evaluation
      * 0 points: No evaluation of retrieval is provided
      * 1 point: Only one retrieval approach is evaluated
      * 2 points: Multiple retrieval approaches are evaluated, and the best one is used
  * RAG evaluation
      * 0 points: No evaluation of RAG is provided
      * 1 point: Only one RAG approach (e.g., one prompt) is evaluated
      * 2 points: Multiple RAG approaches are evaluated, and the best one is used
  * Interface
     * 0 points: No way to interact with the application at all
     * 1 point: Command line interface, a script, or a Jupyter notebook
     * 2 points: UI (e.g., Streamlit), web application (e.g., Django), or an API (e.g., built with FastAPI) 
  * Ingestion pipeline
     * 0 points: No ingestion
     * 1 point: Semi-automated ingestion of the dataset into the knowledge base, e.g., with a Jupyter notebook
     * 2 points: Automated ingestion with a Python script or a special tool (e.g., Mage, dlt, Airflow, Prefect)
  * Monitoring
     * 0 points: No monitoring
     * 1 point: User feedback is collected OR there's a monitoring dashboard
     * 2 points: User feedback is collected and there's a dashboard with at least 5 charts
  * Containerization
      * 0 points: No containerization
      * 1 point: Dockerfile is provided for the main application OR there's a docker-compose for the dependencies only
      * 2 points: Everything is in docker-compose
  * Reproducibility
      * 0 points: No instructions on how to run the code, the data is missing, or it's unclear how to access it
      * 1 point: Some instructions are provided but are incomplete, OR instructions are clear and complete, the code works, but the data is missing
      * 2 points: Instructions are clear, the dataset is accessible, it's easy to run the code, and it works. The versions for all dependencies are specified.
  * Best practices
      * [ ] Hybrid search: combining both text and vector search (at least evaluating it) (1 point)
      * [ ] Document re-ranking (1 point)
      * [ ] User query rewriting (1 point)
  * Bonus points (not covered in the course)
      * [ ] Deployment to the cloud (2 points)
