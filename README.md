# Money Mate - Your Friendly LLM Financial Management Agent

## Project Description
- The goal of Money Mate is to act as a financial advisor analyzing your personal finances and personal investments and providing guidance via natural language
- The primary sources of data will be data from app.monarchmoney.com and wealthica.com

## Data Sourcs

- This app will function by allowing you to either upload an extract from Monarch Money (or alternatively, any csv file that fits the same or similar schema) and a history of investments from Wealthica (or alternatively, any csv file that fits the same or similar schema) or will integrate directly with the Monarch Money API and Wealthica API:

### Monarch Money API
Details on that API can be found here: https://github.com/hammem/monarchmoney and is covered in detail in [Step 1b - Using the API](#step-1b---using-the-api) below

### Wealthica API
Details on the Wealthica API can be found here: https://wealthica.com/ca-en/developers/
 
- Once your data is uploaded, you can then proceed to interrogate your own financial patterns in the past or ask for investment advice
  - Depending on the breadth and history of data you've provided, you can ask questions like: What is my net worth? What are the categories I spend the most in? If I wanted to save an additional $500 per month, can you recommend 3 things I can do?
  - For the investment advice, you can ask questions like: What is my current portfolio? What is the performance of my portfolio? What is the performance of my stocks? What is the performance of my bonds? What is the performance of my crypto? Should I continue to hold this stock? Should I sell this stock? Should I buy more of this stock?
